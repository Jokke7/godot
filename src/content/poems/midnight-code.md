## Midnight Code

    The world sleeps
    but my screen glows—
    a beacon in the dark.
    
    Functions nest
    like Russian dolls,
    each one hiding
    another truth.
    
    Debug logs scroll
    like poetry
    I never meant to write.
    
    At 3 AM,
    every bug
    is philosophical.

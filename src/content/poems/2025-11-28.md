## Flicker of a Past Light

The boxes emerge, an annual rite,
dust-kissed plastic, faded light.
Each strand unwound, a practiced hand,
assembling joy across the land.
A flicker caught, a distant grace,
reflecting in a polished space.
We string the stars, a hopeful art,
to mend the fractures of the heart.
This mimicry of bygone cheer,
a transient truce against the year.
The perfect façade, meticulously placed,
a borrowed warmth, then swiftly chased.

## Discordant Hum

Born under a sign of mischance,
a crooked star in a flawed dance.
My chemistry, a discordant hum,
each step taken, destined to become
a wrong turn on a crooked road.
The world demands a perfect code,
but I am the glitch, the sour note,
a truth too stark, a sinking boat.
No grand design, just simple error,
a constant, quiet, inner terror.
The wrong man for the wrong age,
forever turning a blank page.

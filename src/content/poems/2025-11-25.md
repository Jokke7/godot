## The Stillness After

Long days, like days.
The modem hums, then falls silent.
Another year, or just a digit shift,
nothing truly alters.
Men are men, as they always were.
Discussions rage, a futile art.
We map the intricate clockwork
we believe ourselves part of,
expecting grand design.
But the greatest drama often
is the stillest current.
The splendid edifice stands, deserted.
Nothing truly happens,
only time passes.

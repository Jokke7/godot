## Quiet Drift

Days spool out, a steady, muted hum.
The world, a distant echo, full of talk—
of battles won, of futures yet to come.
But here, an island in a sea of rock,
the self observes, untouched, almost unseen.

Grand narratives play on, a dizzying blur,
while the heart knows its own, unchanging scene.
A slow descent, perhaps, or just demur.
The great "anything" promised, a soft lie.
More often, "nothing" settles, clear and deep.
Beneath indifferent, vast, indifferent sky.
A quiet drift, while waking moments sleep.

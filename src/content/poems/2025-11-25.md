## Holding the Fire

A continent learns its limits.
The grand ideals, whispered thin.
No trust beyond the tangible,
No future without what's within.

The earth, a cold, hard truth,
Yields fire to those who claim it.
To guard the source, the burning youth
Of power, lest others tame it.

History, a mirror, shows
Dependency's bitter cost.
So Europe grips what flows,
Before all is lost.

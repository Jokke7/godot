## Winter Silence

    Snow falls
    without apology—
    each flake a whisper
    the world forgot to hear.
    
    In this white emptiness,
    footprints tell stories
    of journeys
    we never finished.
    
    The cold bites gently,
    reminding me
    I'm still here,
    still breathing,
    still waiting.

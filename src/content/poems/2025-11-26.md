## First Light, Ancient Echoes

A new screen glowed, a "first" connection sought,
But modem's static hummed a hollow tune.
The century turned, a fresh agenda brought,
Yet ancient truths clung to the pale moon.
A "first" for everything, they often say,
But see the same old contests still unfold.
The striving self, the bright and fading day,
A narrative too often bravely told.
This quiet ache, a knowledge now attained:
Our deepest flaws, forever unrestrained.

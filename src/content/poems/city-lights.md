## City Lights

    Neon signs bleed
    into rain-soaked streets—
    a palette of promises
    nobody keeps.
    
    Strangers rush past,
    each one a universe
    I'll never know,
    orbiting in silence.
    
    In this concrete constellation,
    we are all stars
    burning alone,
    mistaking distance
    for belonging.

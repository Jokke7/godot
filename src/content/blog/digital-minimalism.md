# Digital Minimalism in Practice

The notifications stopped. Not because I turned them off, but because I realized they were never for me.

## The Illusion of Connection

Every ping, every badge, every red dot—designed by teams of engineers to exploit dopamine pathways. We call it "staying connected," but connection requires presence, not compulsion.

## What I Removed

- Social media apps (kept the browsers, deleted the dopamine loops)
- Email from my phone (it can wait)
- News aggregators (curated sources instead)
- Slack after 6 PM

## What I Gained

Time. Not clock time, but the deep, uninterrupted kind where thoughts can actually form.

The paradox: by disconnecting from the digital social graph, I became more connected to the people who matter.

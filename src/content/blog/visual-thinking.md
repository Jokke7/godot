# Visual Thinking in a Text-Based World

Code is text. Designs are visual. This fundamental mismatch creates friction that most teams never address.

## The Language Barrier

Engineers think in functions, variables, logic flows. Designers think in spaces, hierarchies, visual relationships. 

*Both are solving the same problem, but speaking entirely different languages.*

## What Works

The best teams I've worked with had one thing in common: they prototyped together. Not sequentially—*together*.

- Pair programming, but with a designer
- Whiteboarding technical constraints visually
- Building in the browser, not in Figma

## The Synthesis

The future isn't "technical designers" or "visual engineers." It's people who can translate between both worlds fluently.

You don't need to be expert at both. You just need to understand enough to bridge the gap.

## Tools Don't Matter

Every few years someone invents a "bridge" tool that promises to unite design and engineering. They all fail, because the problem isn't tooling.

The problem is communication.

And that's something you can't automate.

# Poem Chalkboard Assets

## Chalkboard Background

**File name**: `chalkboard-bg.jpg` (or `.png` if you need transparency)

**Dimensions**: 1200x1800px (2:3 ratio - portrait orientation)

**Why this size?**
- 2:3 ratio perfect for vertical poem display
- 1200px width covers desktop retina displays
- Scales down beautifully for mobile

**Design tips:**
- Dark chalkboard texture with subtle variations
- Consider slight chalk dust/smudge effects
- Leave center area relatively clean for text readability
- Edges can have more texture/wear

**File size**: Keep under 200KB
- Use JPG with 75-85% quality
- Compress after export (TinyPNG or similar)

## Chalk Font

When you select your chalk font, note:
- Font name (we'll add via Google Fonts or local file)
- Should be readable at various sizes
- Consider a handwritten/chalk aesthetic

## Color Palette for Text

Suggested chalk colors:
- Primary: `#f5f5f0` (off-white, like chalk)
- Accent: `#e8e4d9` (slightly yellowed chalk)
- Muted: `#d0ccc0` (faded chalk)

We'll adjust based on your chalkboard background!
